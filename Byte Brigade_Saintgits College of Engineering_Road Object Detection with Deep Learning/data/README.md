# Data

This folder contains all the data and its references, that were used to train the pothole detection model in both YOLOv8 and YOLOv5.
Due to the size of the datasets that were used for training the YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 models. We uploaded them to this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SXLfr6Z3cu56cafJaXDAw7A6ucYI1b9O?usp=sharing). You can also download the dataset directly from Roboflow as well by interacting with the below icon.
